Lab4:
This lab concerns the problem of applying a Kalman filter to a variety of measurements.
The measurements are numerical data that has been recorded over time in order to
Provide samples to filter. There are two measurement sets, one that was recorded in one
Dimension and another recorded in two dimensions. In practice the Kalman filter would be
Used actively to filter the measurements in real time.
